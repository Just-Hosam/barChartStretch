# barChartStretch
Lighthouse Labs Stretch Project. To see the website click [here](https://just-hosam.github.io/barChartStretch/).
## Getting Started
This project is a website that takes input from the user and presents that data on a customizable Bar Chart. Clicking on the bars (after submiting data) will move the values between 3 positions (top, mid and bottom).

The user will enter data into the input table in the "Input Chart Data". Rows can be added indefinitely and deleted.

The title can be dynamically changed by adjsuting the values in the "Dynamic Title Updating" section. The chart can be customized through the input boxes within the "Input Customization Data" section.

## Known Issues/Bugs
* Adding more than 9 bars results in the y-axis ticks breaking off
* Having too small of a bar will result in the displayed values overlaping other parts of the bar chart
* The spacing between bars is not customizable as the number of bars automatically adjusts the width
## Future Features
* Make multiple values stack for a single x-axis value
* Reset the chart (not just the input table) when clicking on the "Reset" button
