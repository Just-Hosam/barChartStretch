# barChartStretch
Lighthouse Labs Stretch Project
## Getting Started
This project is a website that takes input from the user and presents that data on a customizable Bar Chart.

The user will enter data into the input table in the "Input Chart Data". Rows can be added indefinitely and deleted.

The title can be dynamically changed by adjsuting the values in the "Dynamic Title Updating" section. The chart can be customized through the input boxes within the "Input Customization Data" section.
